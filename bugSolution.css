Several solutions can address this issue:

**1. Using `text-overflow: ellipsis;`:** This approach adds an ellipsis (...) at the end of the text when it overflows its container. This is a clean solution if truncation is visually acceptable.

```css
.container::before {
  content: "This is a long string that might overflow.";
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  white-space: nowrap;
  overflow: hidden;
  text-overflow: ellipsis;
}
```

**2. Allowing text wrapping:**  Remove `white-space: nowrap;` to let the text wrap within the container's boundaries.  This solution works well if wrapping is suitable for the design.  You may also need to adjust `width` and `height` of the container.

```css
.container::before {
  content: "This is a long string that might overflow.";
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  /* white-space: nowrap; removed */
}
```

Choose the approach that best fits your design requirements.  If you need more sophisticated text handling, explore techniques like JavaScript-based solutions to dynamically handle overflowing text.
