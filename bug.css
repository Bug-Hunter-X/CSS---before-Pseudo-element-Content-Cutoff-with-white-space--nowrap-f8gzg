The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an unusual issue where the `::before` pseudo-element's content is unexpectedly cut off when applying specific styling: 

```css
.container {
  width: 200px;
  height: 100px;
  position: relative;
}

.container::before {
  content: "This is a long string that might overflow.";
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  white-space: nowrap; /* This might be the source of unexpected behavior */
}
```

The problem is that `white-space: nowrap;` is used which usually prevents text wrapping. This can cause unexpectedly cutoff text when the container doesn't have enough width to hold the whole string.
